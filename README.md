Circuit Crawler is an Android game made by a group of Sage Hill School students
as a Service Learning project. It was made in parternship with the Youth for
Technology Foundation, and the proceeds of the game went directly to them.

The latest version of the game available here never make it to the Play Store,
but it should still serve as an example of a game that was taken from concept
to release. Because we had a deadline, we didn't overcomplicate or excessively
abstract things. Features were cut, lots of things were hardcoded. For a game
made without an engine, Circuit Crawler handles the following things in a
reasonable manner:

 - Hierarichal entity system
 - Physics
 - AI
 - Triggers (elementary form of scripting)
 - Level and asset management
 - Input handling
 - Abstraction of OpenGL ES
